# ðŸ§© Real-Time Shape Detection Using Contours

## Overview
This project implements a **real-time shape detection** system using computer vision techniques.  
It uses contour detection to recognize and classify basic geometric shapes (such as circles, rectangles, triangles, etc.) from a live video feed or pre-recorded videos.

The system leverages OpenCV's image processing functions to identify, label, and track shapes dynamically.

## Project Objectives
- Capture frames from a camera or video source
- Perform image preprocessing (grayscale, blurring, edge detection)
- Detect contours and approximate polygonal curves
- Classify shapes based on the number of edges
- Display results in real time with labels on detected shapes

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
